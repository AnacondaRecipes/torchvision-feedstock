# CONDA_BUILD_SYSROOT is defined in the base cbc.yaml, but it's reflected here so we can zip the keys and
# build GPU and CPU at the same time for osx-arm64. It'll need to be manually updated here if the base cbc is changed.
# This could be done using extend_keys instead, with a change to the base cbc.yaml.
# However there's currently a conda-forge bug that prevents this: https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/5048
